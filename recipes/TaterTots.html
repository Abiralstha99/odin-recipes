        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 medium russet potatoes, peeled</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt or to taste</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon seasoned pepper</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
          <li>2 cups peanut oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil.
            Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes;
            drain and cool until easily handled, 10 to 15 minutes.
          </li>

          <li>
            Shred potatoes with a box grater; drain excess water. Transfer
            shredded potato into a large mixing bowl; stir in parsley, flour,
            salt, seasoned pepper, and onion powder until combined. Shape potato
            mixture into 1-inch long potato nuggets.
          </li>

          <li>
            Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175
            degrees C).
          </li>

          <li>
            Lower potato nuggets carefully into the hot oil in batches, about 5
            to 10 at a time. Fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3 to 4
            minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with
            remaining nuggets.
          </li>
